This project focuses on solving one of the most common and costly challenges in retail and supply chain management: balancing inventory levels to meet customer demand while minimizing excess stock. Using a real retail dataset with daily sales and inventory levels, the project applies simple, transparent methods to forecast product demand and recommend optimal inventory actions. By resampling daily sales into weekly totals and applying a 4-week moving average forecast, the tool identifies products at risk of stock-outs or overstock, calculates recommended reorder quantities with a safety buffer, and generates an actionable decision table. Although designed with beginner-friendly techniques, the project demonstrates strong business value by showing how even basic forecasting can reduce lost sales, lower holding costs, and improve decision-making.
